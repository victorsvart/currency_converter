# SIMPLE CURRENCY CONVERTER
This is a currency converter that I made as my first "big" C++ project. Have been working on it
since June and did most of the work on that month too. Thought about making it public so anyone can mess with the code and add a new currency. 

I think it's a nice project for beginner's like me to practice. So if you see this, feel free
to download it and do whatever you want with it. Add a new currency, maybe an interface. It's all up to you!
